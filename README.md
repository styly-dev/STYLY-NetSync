## Overview

A minimal, high-performance networking package for Unity — built specifically for location-based entertainment (LBE) experiences.
STYLY NetSync includes an easy-to-integrate Unity package and a lightweight Python server to make real-time, synchronized XR sessions easy to build and deploy in venue networks.

**Highlights**

- **Super easy to use** — simple API and drop-in package so you can integrate fast and get running with minimal setup.
- **Super lightweight** — low CPU / memory footprint; optimized network traffic for stable performance on local networks.
- **Optimized for LBE** — syncs virtual and physical transforms and offers Human Presence (collision avoidance).

## Features

### Main features
- Avatar Transform Synchronization
- RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
- Network Variable

### Other features
- One-click SDK setup for HMDs
- Multifunctional XR Rig
- Battery level management

Some features are provided via dependent package STYLY XR Rig.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

uv/uvx: Required to start the server.
OpenUPM: Required only when you add the package to your Unity project.

```shell
# Windows
winget install -e --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS --source winget
winget install -e --id astral-sh.uv --source winget
npm install -g openupm-cli

# Mac
brew install node
brew install uv
npm install -g openupm-cli

# Mac
brew install node
brew install uv
npm install -g openupm-cli
```

### Add / Update STYLY-NetSync to Unity project

```shell
# Go to your unity project directory
cd YOUR_UNITY_PROJECT_DIR

# Add/Update NetSync package with specific version
openupm add -f com.styly.styly-netsync@0.7.4
```

## Setup

### Start NetSync server


```shell
# Start NetSync server
# Use the same version of the Unity package
uvx styly-netsync-server@0.7.4

# [Optional] Start client simulator
uvx --from styly-netsync-server@0.7.4 styly-netsync-simulator --clients 10
```
The uvx command automatically downloads the package, creates an isolated virtual environment, installs dependencies, and runs the python server program.


### Setup Unity scene

| SDK setup for HMDs | STYLY XR Rig |
|---|---|
| ![Setup SDK](_images/Screenshots/Setup_SDK.png)<br>Downloads and installs SDK, and sets up configurations. See more [details](https://github.com/styly-dev/STYLY-XR-Rig/blob/develop/Packages/com.styly.styly-xr-rig/Editor/SetupSDK/README.md). | ![STYLY XR Rig](_images/Screenshots/Add_STYLY_XR_Rig.png)<br>Supports most of samples in XR Interaction Toolkit, MR mode of HMDs, WASD control in Unity Editor mode and stick locomotion with HMD controllers.  |

<strong>Properties</strong>
- _deviceId - Displays the unique device ID assigned to this client.
- _clientNo - Shows the numeric client number assigned by the server.
- _serverAddress - Server IP or hostname; leave empty to auto-discover on the local network.
- _roomId - Identifier of the current room to join.
- _localAvatarPrefab - Prefab used for the local user's avatar.
- _remoteAvatarPrefab - Prefab used for remote users'avatars.
- _humanPresencePrefab - Prefab shown at each remote user's physical position (used for "human presence" visualization).

<strong>Events</strong>
- OnAvatarConnected - Triggered when a remote avatar connects to the network, passing the client number as an argument.
- OnAvatarDisconnected - Triggered when a remote avatar disconnects from the network, passing the client number as an argument.
- OnRPCReceived - Triggered when a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is received from another client, passing the sender's client number, function name and arguments.
- OnGlobalVariableChanged - Triggered when a global network variable is changed by another client, passing the variable name, old value and new value.
- OnClientVariableChanged - Triggered when a client-specific network variable is changed by another client, passing the target client number, variable name, old value and new value.
- OnReady - Triggered when the NetSyncManager is fully ready and connected to the server with handshake completed and network variables synchronized.

## Unity C# API Reference

### Namespace Import
```csharp
// Import STYLY NetSync
using Styly.NetSync;
```


### RPC
```csharp
// Broadcast to all clients in the room
NetSyncManager.Instance.Rpc("FunctionName", new string[] { "arg1", "arg2" });

// Receive RPCs
NetSyncManager.Instance.OnRPCReceived.AddListener((senderClientNo, functionName, args) =>
{
    Debug.Log($"RPC(senderClientNo): {senderClientNo}");
    Debug.Log($"RPC(functionName): {functionName}");
    foreach (var arg in args) Debug.Log($"RPC(args): {arg}");
});
```

### Network Variable
```csharp
// Set global variable (shared across all clients in room)
NetSyncManager.Instance.SetGlobalVariable("gameState", "playing");

// Set client-specific variable (set your own)
NetSyncManager.Instance.SetClientVariable("playerScore", "100");

// Set another client's variable (requires their client number)
NetSyncManager.Instance.SetClientVariable("health", "50", targetClientNo);

// Get variables
string gameState = NetSyncManager.Instance.GetGlobalVariable("gameState");
string score = NetSyncManager.Instance.GetClientVariable("playerScore", clientNo);

// Get variables with default value
string gameState = NetSyncManager.Instance.GetGlobalVariable("gameState", "Initial State");

// Listen for value changes
NetSyncManager.Instance.OnGlobalVariableChanged.AddListener((name, oldVal, newVal) => {
    Debug.Log($"Global var {name} changed: {oldVal} -> {newVal}");
});

NetSyncManager.Instance.OnClientVariableChanged.AddListener((clientNo, name, oldVal, newVal) => {
    Debug.Log($"Client {clientNo} var {name} changed: {oldVal} -> {newVal}");
});

```
